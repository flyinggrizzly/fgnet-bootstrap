My larger chunks of time off tend to be the time when I also get a lot of self-admin and personal projects moved forward. This year was no exception.

<!-- more -->

This year, in no particular order (except where it's obviously ordered), I:

- upgraded my Confluence server to 6.6.0
- thought seriously about abandoning Confluence for [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum)
- upgraded my Dokku server
- broke my Dokku deployments
- fixed my Dokku deplpyments
- remembered how Linux services work...
- [set up Staticman]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-12-21-setting-up-staticman.md %}) for comments
- wrote a blog post about setting up Staticman
- [set up my own Staticman server]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-12-31-setting-up-staticman-server.md %}) to run the comments
- wrote a blog post about setting up my Staticman server
- did some work on a feature addition for [Speakerline](http://speakerline.io) (though not as much as I would have liked)
- started using [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instead of Twitter (though I'm still there cuz social world inertia)

I also spent a good chunk of time with family, which was aces. And listened to oooooodles of [Friends at the Table](http://friendsatthetable.net). And *finally* started playing the Witcher 3. And loved the bajeezus out of [Gorogoa](http://gorogoa.com/).

So yea. Not a bad couple of weeks all said.
