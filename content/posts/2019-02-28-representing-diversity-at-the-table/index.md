So I've been thinking a lot lately about how to include people who are not 'like
me' in a tabletop roleplaying game I'm running. It's a game set in the nearish
future in Southern California, during Gundam's One Year War (just before the
events of the _Mobile Suit Gundam_ anime). And in setting something in
California, one of the first commitments I made to myself was that it would
not efface the presence of Latinx, Native, Black, or Asian people who live there
today and make the place their home, and better.

<!-- more -->

This of course presents me with an issue: how do I do this respectfully and
without denigrating anyone, coopting people's experiences, or making them into
tokens? (Unintentionally, but that doesn't matter.) It is not acceptable for me
to speak _for_ or _use_ anyone else, but I also will not contribute to the
ongoing casual erasure of these people's presence in the place I grew up.

I am a white person, I can pass for cis/het male any time I want, and have done for
all of my life (I've only recently really begun to understand or express my
genderqueerness)... I carry a lot of privilege. But this post isn't an "oh woe is me
and my privilege", or a "hey look I'm doing good give me a cookie" thing. The
game is hitting really charged material and I owe it to myself, the other
players, the audience, and **most of all** the people I'm representing to be clear
about where I'm coming from, why I'm doing this, and what work I'm doing to do
it right.

I want to summarize the answers to these questions before I go further:

- I am doing this so that I am not contributing to the ongoing erasure of people
    of color in the place I grew up
- I am not doing this because I need victims in a story--we have them already
    (everyone). The PoC characters are here, again, because I don't want to erase
    them
- do research and homework to understand the histories of these peoples
    with the colonizing white culture in Souther California and the US
- give characters from these groups real agency and motivation, and don't let
    them be completely subservient to the player characters, or tokens of their
    culture/ethnicity

## The deeper dive

This post is going to focus on representing people from the Native California
Cahuilla bands.

There are people who have come before me who have written about representing
cultures other than your own at the table. [James Mendez
Hodes](https://jamesmendezhodes.com/bio), a writer and game designer, who is
also an Eastern Classics scholar and who is also Filipino, has written some
_very_ good pieces about this. One generally addressing the topic, and others as
reflections on this work and process in a game he's worked on called [_Thousand
Arrows_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galileogames/thousand-arrows-a-samurai-action-and-drama-ttrpg/updates)

- [Best practices for historical gaming (also _Thousand Arrows_ related)](https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2018/11/10/best-practices-for-historical-gaming)

To address some of his biggest questions: why? and how?...

Why? Because, as I've said just a few paras up, these are people who live in
California now and contribute to its character as a place, whom I will not
erase. He cautions against using people because you need a plight--there is
definitely a differential relationship in the real world that's reflected in the
game between Native peoples and our current dominant culture, but that's not
_why_ they're there. It will come up, but isn't our driver.

As for how... this takes a little more explanation I think, because it's always
what you do, not why you did it, that matters in the end. First, you should read
those articles because he is smarter than me. But for my purposes, the most important
thing he has to say is "don't buy in to the stereotypes, but find the shared
spaces".

For example, as someone for someone for whom the knight trope is emic rather
than etic, calling a samurai a knight refocuses my attention as a non-Japanese
person on the characteristics of the trope that are shared. I'm less likely to
get obsessed with orientalist ideas like _samurai are strong and never falter
and do the disciplined but magical kiai when they attack_. I'm instead more
likely to consider how I would react in a given situation, and act from a place
of empathy[^1], and not reduce a person to bad stereotypes.

At this point in the game I'm running, I have introduced on screen (so to speak)
characters from the some of the Cahuilla bands of Native Americans, who are
native to what is now Palm Springs, Temecula, Morongo, and the Coachella Valley
in Southern California. Specifically, these are characters from the Morongo band
of Cahuilla. You might know the name from Casino Morongo, which they own, out
near Palm Springs[^2].

In presenting these characters, I've kept a few things in mind:

- no stereotypes. There's not a feather in sight, and no
    elder talking slowly, in slightly archaic and yet eloquent English, about
    future or destiny or some shit
- do my research. This is ongoing, but you betcha I'm digging into the history
    of the Cahuilla, and am doing the same for Vietnamese and Korean American
    populations in LA
- don't erase social, cultural or ethnic difference in trying to be 'race-blind' (ugh).
    Rather than attach visual/clothing signifiers, I am working with the
    landscape. Introducing the characters at Hadley's Fruit Stand, which is
    owned by the Morongo, instead of some random place, grounds them (I hope) in
    their their culture (also, not going for the obvious choice of the casino
    owned by and named for the band)[^3]
- not all Cahuilla bands are the same. 20 minutes from the casino, there is the
    Agua Caliente Cahuilla reservation, home to the Agua Caliente Cahuilla.
    These are a different band, and though they're not on screen yet, they will
    be. And they have their own heckin' goals
- speaking of goals, these people have concrete agency. Player dice rolls may
    indicate within the fiction that these NPCs respond positively to the player
    characters, but it *doesn't* mean that they just become mouthpieces on a
    fetchquest or something. They're not bending over backwards. Alarn, Tamith,
    and Horst all have their own agendas, and are actively pursuing them, even
    (already, possibly depending on player interpretation) to the PCs'
    detriment, despite the PCs rolling a 6 when meeting them
- this agenda is what I think is a real (read: righteously angry) response
    to centuries of oppression and degradation at the hands of colonizers. It's
    not _about_ the history of white oppression, but it's informed by it. For
    someone who has a history of constantly being robbed by governments, anger
    at anyone new coming in and demanding use of native-owned land seems pretty
    hecking reasonable and real to me. Things in Gundam have gotten worse in
    terms of economic and opportunity disparity, not better. I see no indication
    in the anime that the people losing that bargain have changed from
    today[^4]. They've been largely left out to dry by everyone 'in charge', so
    fuck yes they're doing things for themselves
- I'm also not relegating the Cahuilla bands and characters to being reactionary
    to white action. There will be focus on oppression in general in this game
    because that's what the Zeon occupation does, but it's not the only thing.
    It was a small scene, but I made sure that when we introduced Tamith and
    Alarn, it was in an unrelated place and action--tailgating at a milkshake
    stand in the desert, not dedicating all their energy to resisting. Because
    life is life, and people are people

Basically, make them _people_ first and foremost, and let them act on their own
terms, not as my plot needs them.

DC has [written a (little)
](https://twitter.com/dungeoncommandr/status/986617723466612736) on a similar
theme, specifically in relation to representing blackness or "tribal Africa"
(sic) in a DnD-esque setting. Their advice falls somewhere between "don't", and
"put it in the future" where you're not subject to the heavy, _heavy_ weight of
real histories of oppression. To paraphrase them, "just don't choose something
that has (or displays, but that's a whole other bag) too much
cultural/historical similarity to real-world people" unless you're really doing
the research to understand these people you are taking on the work of
representing, and also including them in a meaningful way. Dropping them in for
a hot second and then forgetting them is tokenism bullshit that lets you
feel good for being woke while actually having just instrumentalized someone's
lived experience for your own gain. Guess what, that's more exploitation.

This is where I'm living. I am doing research on the Cahuilla. And I'm not
letting these Cahuilla characters be a drop in the bucket. Blades games have
many factions, so they're not the only players, but they're not small players.
Having introduced them, they are here for the long haul. And they are doing what
(I can best imagine) _they_ would do in the situation that Gundam's Universal
Century puts them in.

In the end, it's not for me to judge how effective we are at our table. We might
end up being horrible. I sincerely hope we do not, and I am putting in work to
make sure of that. But it is a possibility I need to keep in mind. So I also
would like to get someone to sensitivity audit the show when I can afford it.
And, if you see something I or we fuck up, and you feel comfortable, please tell
me (get at me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flying_grizzly), [email
me](mailto:hi@grz.li), whatever if anything you are comfortable with). I'm doing
this because the kind of story we're telling, in the place we're telling it,
would be dishonest if we didn't include people who are oppressed today.  I don't
want to erase that.

[^1]: I always confuse sympathy and empathy. What I mean to say is "a thing that I would do in this situation"
[^2]: I don't want to get into the issue of Native casinos, but I do err on the side of "it's their land, they get to do what they want, back off and let them succeed in the rigged game we've backed everyone into". Pretty often people who have bad things to say about casinos have very little to offer as an alternative.
[^3]: Because this is a non-visual medium, and we have to rely on listener memories anyways, I'm preferring to work with this kind of association over visual because the Cahuilla's traditional dress falls right into what is now the visual stereotype of Native Americans--feathers, beads, headdresses (which are all gorgeous by the way--I encourage you to look up images from the Morongo band's annual Pow Wow), and more casual visual indicators are less reliable online, or just fall into what is basically good sensible modern desert-wear and not specific to the Cahuilla. Making one of the first associations the audience and players have with these characters a really cool place in the California desert that the band owns I think is a stronger move than others I could make.
[^4]: In fact, there is strong indication that the power structures in place when the anime was made are still dominant, and exacerbated. In the _Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ_ episodes "Blue Team" parts 1 and 2, we see how things have just gotten worse in a what is implied to be a former French colony in Northern Africa or the Arabian peninsula. And yes, Northern Africa and Southern California are different places, but also Western consumption of others is pretty similar and constant. Those episodes guide me when I think about what life must be like for people in Gundam's Universal Century.
