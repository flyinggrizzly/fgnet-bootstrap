When I woke up today, one of the first things I saw was Kai Cole (architect, and
pertinently in this circumstance Joss Whedon's ex-wife) had written in The Wrap
about [her marriage to Joss Whedon, and its
end](http://www.thewrap.com/joss-whedon-feminist-hypocrite-infidelity-affairs-ex-wife-kai-cole-says/).
It's heart-breaking. I've updated my [open letter to Joss]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
link _posts/2017-03-10-open-letter-to-joss-whedon-thank-you.md
%}#callout-thoughts-after-kai-coles-piece-in-the-wrap) in response.

I hate this. Joss has been a hugely visible voice for good
  things in the world. But there's no point in being blind to the horrible
  things he has done. I still also can't deny that his work has had a hugely positive
  impact on my life. That's what the other post is really all about. Which
  doesn't excuse what he did.

I am going to focus more of my gratitude for _BtVS_ and what it's done for me on
  the rest of the cast and crew. Marti Noxon, Jane Espenson, SMG, Steve
  DeKnight, Eliza Dushku, Alyson Hannigan, Drew Goddard... which I should have
  been doing from the get-go more anyways.

Shit. I don't have any answers. I'm going to stop trying to have them. But [the
  Mary Sue's post](https://www.themarysue.com/kai-cole-joss-whedon-hypocrisy/) on
  this sums it up better than me:

> Now, just so we can get it out of the way: yes, this piece comes with the
  caveats that (1) people who are recently divorced sometimes say shitty,
  exaggerated things about one another because they’re in a lot of pain (2)
  monogamy, especially given its patriarchal history, is not a pre-condition for
  a feminist life. (Honesty with your partner(s) is, though!) It’s fine to
  consider these two points when absorbing this piece, but don’t try and use
  them to dismiss it, okay?

> This must’ve been an incredibly difficult piece for Cole to write, and –
  whatever positive impact Whedon’s work may have had on the industry, or on any
  of us personally – it sounds like he was a pretty terrible husband. I’m sorry
  she had to put up with this so quietly for so long, and I hope speaking up will
  help her heal.
