So, the [6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) of the internet is the theorem that no matter where one starts on Wikipedia, by clicking the first link on a page (that isn't in a parenthetical or one of those info blocks above the main article body), one will eventually reach [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosphy).

I tested this.

Turns out, there are people who have done this far better than I have, and the wiki page [about this game/theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) has some great examples, including a far more exhaustive approach than the one I took. Basically, someone crawled Wikipedia with a Python script, and there is an awesome gif of it, and some really cool data visualizations.

### Some quick stats about the game (courtesy of the game's wiki page)

- 97% of articles conform to the theorem
- The remainder loop between a few articles or go to pages that don't exist
- It takes 7 clicks to go from Philosophy to Philosophy
- It takes 9 clicks to go from Getting to Philosophy to Philosophy


### My game

I started out on [Arthur C. Clarke's page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke). I can't remember why. Someone had told me something about a Clarke book I think, and then a couple hours later I remembered the game, and the Clarke page presented a suitably random starting point.

I cheated on the first run (by accident, due to lack of information, but still). From Clarke's page, it was 16 links to get to Philosophy, aside from a loop you get caught in jumping between pages about old noble houses that were named Clarke/Clark.

That is exactly how I cheated though. I wasn't aware of the rule about no parenthetical links (I used them), and I forced my way out of loops by clicking the second link on pages I had previously visited (this was in a new incognito window, so previous browsing wasn't messing my results for this). By the official rules of the game, I think it is impossible to get from Arthur C. Clarke to Philosphy on Wikipedia.

### Realizing my error

When trying to explain the game to a friend, I realized I had never looked at the actual 'rules', such as they are, and so slacked them a link to the Wikipedia page for the game. Then I discovered my error. Time to correct it.

### Navigating the great expanse of Wikipedia from the Sci-Fi Grandmaster to Philosophy, part deux

Remember how I said it's impossible to do this by the 'official' rules? I was wrong. It's impossible if you use parenthetical links. And I never got there... I gave up after 100 links.

But I had some weird pages and patterns come up along the way. Notably:

- 2 unique trips to Australia
  - Melbourne, which linked me to Sydney
  - later on, got to a different page about Sydney, which brought up the Australian continent, and then the geological plate
- The Muppets (huzzah!)
- Several rock bands of different styles and eras, only 2 of which I had heard of previously

The other thing I discovered, is that if you click around long enough, people on Wikipedia like to talk about Wikipedia. About the mid 90's in my click-journey, I started getting to pages about *how to edit the wiki, and use the wiki's tools.* It was kinda meta. The 100th page? [Wikipedia's File Upload Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard). There didn't seem to be any escape, the pagesabout Wikipedia on Wikipedia seem to have their own gravitational field

### Most importantly
Starting at the 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon page, you need only 14 clicks to get to Philosophy. This journey does not include a stop at Getting to Philosophy.
