I was out sick from work a couple of days this week, and I found I was starting to get depressed. Turns out it was because I was sitting on my butt for so long.

I noticed the first day I was going in to work that I was already starting to feel better. It was when I was making my breakfast, first thing, ass-early in the morning.

Turns out (and [it's entirely possible I've realized this before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-08-09-how-i-cope-with-depression.md %}) and forgotten) that taking concrete action early every day helps me stay steady.

Hurrah for that!
