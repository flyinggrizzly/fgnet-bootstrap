So... because I posted _so little_ here last year, when I was looking at the
site again after publishing my [last
post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-13-hacking-blades-in-the-dark %}),
and I saw that I had written a ["What I did over the holidays"
post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-07-what-i-did-over-the-holidays %})
last year. I didn't do much this year, but I figure, hey, why not.

<!-- more -->

TBH... I'm partly just writing this post so I can get back in the swing of
regular blogging[^1].

Over the holidays I...

- hacked some Ikea furniture so we can hang [nice folding
    chairs](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/chairs-stools-benches/chairs/terje-folding-chair-beech-art-64833108/)
    from the bottom of our
    [new shelves](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/storage-furniture/shelving-units-systems/ivar-1-section-shelves-pine-spr-89248314/)
    (this probably merits a post of its own cuz I'm pretty proud of the solution
    to limited floor space in our apartment)
- read a few books (_Ancillary Justice_ by Ann Leckie - very good; _Gundam:
    Awakening, Escalation, Confrontation_ by Tomino Yoshiyuki - ...middling I'd
    say; _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ Vol. 1 - exciting, and I'm looking
    forward to more)
- recorded the first session for [Mobile Suit Breakdown
    Plays](https://gundampodcast.com/patreon), which I'm GMing for my really
    good friends
- played some _Scum and Villainy_ with friends over Roll20/Discord
- did a bunch of good work on [_Against the Titans of
    War_](https://grz.li/titans), which is a Forged in the Dark game I'm making
    where you play through a conflict very like the Gryps War of _Zeta Gundam_
- hung out with my (amazing!) wife, whom I adore
- had more work done on my tattoo (a full sleeve on my right arm with a sea
    otter, kelp, and some gorgeous gorgeous waves - pics when it's done) by
    [Jesse Rodriguez](https://www.instagram.com/mugs_one/)

For now, I think that's it. It's very possible I forgot something, but for now
that's good enough!
