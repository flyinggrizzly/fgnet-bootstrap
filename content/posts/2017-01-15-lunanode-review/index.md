Short quick review of [Lunanode](http://www.lunanode.com) from my phone: they're awesome. 

<!-- more -->

I just had an amazing experience with Lunanode support. 

I was trying to snapshot my VPS before they put their systems into maintenance tonight (plenty of warning which was nice), and I kept getting a failure notification. 

First win for Lunanode: the failure notice had decent troubleshooting recommendations inline. 

Unfortunately they didn't work. But within a couple more minutes, one of their support agents emailed me saying that the error was resolved and I should try again. That was the second win, but it actually gets better. 

*I hadn't contacted them yet.*

They were awesomely proactive and took care of me before I could ask. 

That's how you win customers the right way.
