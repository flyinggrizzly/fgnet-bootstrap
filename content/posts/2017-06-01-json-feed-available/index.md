Super quick one--I just jumped on the JSON feed bandwagon, so you can now get all the stuff here at [flyinggrizzly.io/feed.json]({{ site.url }}/feed.json). I'm not using it yet, but it took me less than a minute to set up (merging the PRs took longer than the actual work, which mirrors the reports from just about everyone else, including the [guy whose code I aped](https://ndarville.com/blog/2017/05/19/json-feed-for-jekyll/)--thanks dude!).

Let me know if it's useful!

PS - if you've not yet encountered JSON feeds, [check out their site](https://jsonfeed.org/), and you can also read [John Gruber's gushings about it](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+json+feed&ia=web) (<- those are search results scoped to [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net)).
