  An exploration of the origins of the Zaku's iconic design, combining sources
  from interviews with Okawara, popular sci-fi magazines from 1978 Japan,
  Japanese airforce equipment, and the history of robots and cyclopses in film.
---

I'm currently rewatching _Mobile Suit Gundam_, following along with [Mobile Suit
Breakdown's](https://gundampodcast.com) ongoing journey through the series
providing historical and cultural context and background. At some point in my
rewatch, it occurred to me: both _MSG_ and _Battlestar Galactica_ both came out
in 1979, and have an **incredibly**  iconic villain robot with a glowing red,
single sweeping eye. The _mono-eye_.

<!-- more -->

So, of course, I decided I needed to discover more about their shared visual
idiom.

# "Just give it a monoeye", or the usual story about the Zaku's design

So, the usual story that gets tossed around about where design for the Zaku came
from is that Tomino gave Okawara free reign to design it how he liked. The toy
sponsor, Clover, wasn't intending to sell Zaku toys, which meant that they
weren't being watched like hawks for marketability (and yet... it's one of the
best selling gunpla models, says me, based on very casual observation).

This gave Okawara permisison to explore two major themes in the Zaku's design:

- asymmetry design (symmetry made the toy manufacturing process a lot
    easier)[^asymmetry-of-design]
- colors outside of the usual bright primary spectrum (easier to manufacture,
    and more marketable to children)

The only stricture Tomino reportedly gave Okawara was "give it a monoeye".

This story is one of those things that are just accepted Gundam legend.
Thankfully, with some digging, you can find solid references. This is from an
interview Okawara did with the Sankei newspaper in 2015 for his big design
retrospective exhibition, translated by
[@kraker2k](https://web.archive.org/web/20190410140412/https://vanishingtrooper.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/interview-with-kunio-okawara-from-the-sankei-newspaper/):

> For “Mobile Suit Gundam” the “Zaku” was originally not meant to go on sale so
> I was given a lot of freedom with the design, I had a lot of fun designing it.
> Director Yoshiyuki Tomino only had a single design request for me and that was
> the “mono-eye”, other than that I designed the [sic] everything else myself.

More recently, the heroic
[@wantstobeapanda](https://twitter.com/wantstobeapanda) has [translated an
interview](http://web.archive.org/web/20190410082652/https://criesinnewtype.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/behind-gundams-creation/)
with the many of the creators of _Mobile Suit Gundam_ that was released on NHK
this month for the show's 40th anniversary. In Okawara's own words:

> The Gundam, Guncanon, and Guntank were only possible after collecting and
> condensing the pooled ideas of the staff and sponsors. The enemies on the
> other hand usually weren’t sold as products, so I had a lot more fun creating
> the Zeon mechs...

> I had complete freedom. All Tomino wanted was a mono-eye, everything else
> after that was entirely up to me. Before coming into this industry I worked
> with apparel, so the Zaku had a business suit sort of design. After hearing
> from Tomino about the mono-eye, it took me only about a week to turn around a
> design. The second draft became the final draft. They really let me do
> whatever I wanted.

Looking at the books I've collected, it's clear that the Zaku went through a few
iterations before it was finalized. It gets to looking roughly like the Zaku we
know quite quickly, but there are one or two early outliers. Here's a picture of
a very early (possibly first) draft from _Gundam Age_[^gundam-age], page 79:

![A _very_ early Zaku design showing two eyes... also, can you _imagine_ if the Gundam had **batwings???**](/post-assets/images/post-images/gundam-age-page-78-79.jpg)

In a nutshell, the usual story is that Okawara got to do whatever he wanted
as long as he gave it a single eye. The two questions that motivate this article
are

- why did Tomino insist on the monoeye?
- given so much freedom, where _did_ Okawara pull inspiration for the Zaku from?

Let's see if we can't find out.

# General resources

There are some really good articles, and even interviews with Okawara, that talk
about the design process more generally, and what it was like to work on the
show at the time. They don't go deeper than off-hand mentions of things like the
business suit, but they are absolutely worth reading if you have the time:

- [Interview with Okawara by Ollie Barder from
    Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/07/29/kunio-okawara-the-man-who-designed-gundam-and-created-the-profession-of-mechanical-design/),
    in which he talks about his process and approach, and which MS he really had
    influence over (the Forbes site seems to be allergic to backing up on the
    Internet archive, so if that link dies, I've [saved it as an ugly PDF for
    posterity](/assets/attachments/ollie-barder-forbes-okawara-interview-2016.pdf))
- a really great dive into the [Zaku's impact and ongoing
    influence](https://www.zimmerit.moe/the-ms-06-zaku-ii-an-enduring-eye-con/)
    from [Grant Jones](https://twitter.com/colonydrop) at Zimmerit.moe. It
    focuses primarily on the history of the Zaku _since_ it was first created,
    and less on its design origins
- the article from the [Sankei
    newspaper,](https://web.archive.org/web/20190410140412/https://vanishingtrooper.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/interview-with-kunio-okawara-from-the-sankei-newspaper/)
    translated by [@kraker2k](https://twitter.com/kraker2) is a nice
    mini-biography of Okawara

Unfortunately, these are usually too general for our purposes, although their
insights into Okawara's approach and attitude (which is delightful--he just
loved to do the work he was doing) are useful.

# Beginning the search

Trying to find out exactly _where_ the Zaku's design sprang from, and whether it
was related to the Cylon, led me down a rabbit-hole trying to find out the origin
of this eye. Was the Zaku copied from the Cylon? The other way around? Do the
two share some referential DNA? I ended up importing some _very_ cool Gundam art
and design books, some _very_ old sci-fi magazine back issues from Japan, and
spending a good chunk of time researching robots in film in my search to find
out.

I'm going to take a somewhat meandering tour through this, but I think it's the
order that makes the most sense.

First things first, in case you haven't seen either the 1979 Cylon Centurion, or
the Zaku, here we are.

## Quick note about veracity of sources

I'm trying to work with primary sources wherever possible, but... it's a little
hard considering I don't speak the language. I'm relying a lot on a wonderful
community of fan translators, Google translate, Chrome's built-in translations,
and a few other things. I'm also falling back to secondary sources where I have
to.

There are also a lot of accepted stories around that don't have good
documentation. Things like Char being named after Charles Aznavour, who was very
popular with women in Japan at the time, have some credibility, but can still be
hard to authenticate in the way they're usually told.

Also, it's worth noting that Tomino is _notorious_ for contradicting thing's
he's already said, as well as commonly accepted critical stances (like that the
Gundam is inspired by Samurai armor...).  Basically, this can all get a little
grey. But we're going to do the best we can, 'kay? Okay!

So let's dive in.

## Initial search failures

I spent a long time putting search terms into engines in some combination of
"zaku", "gundam", "battlestar", "cylon", "monoeye"... without much luck.

The good thing is that this eventually lead me to that [Zimmerit.moe
article](https://www.zimmerit.moe/the-ms-06-zaku-ii-an-enduring-eye-con/) I
mentioned, which was a great read on the general history of the Zaku. I highly
recommend reading it. The Zimmerit article is great, but is more interested in
tracing the ongoing history of the Zaku and its ongoing impact on Gundam, and
Japanese pop-culture in general than the specifics of the design's roots.

There are also a scattering of fan-translated interviews with Okawara, but if
the origins of the Zaku ever come up, they generally rehash the usual story
(which is incomplete!) of where it came from.

I eventually resorted to buying random art and design books on Gundam from
[Mandarake](https://mandarake.co.jp), which, if I'm honest, was financially
irresponsible (but now I have awesome Gundam stuff), but I got lucky and got a
hit reasonably early on with an interview and an old magazine ad for
_Barbarella_ (yea, the Jane Fonda movie). I'll get to that in a second.

# History of cinema robots and cyclopses

Until I got the lucky break, I was casting a wide net, and trying to make
educated guesses about what might lead to more information:

- looking for BSG ads that aired in Japan (I could only find a few from CBS)
- other instances of movie robots with a mono-eye
- any movie monsters with a mono-eye

I'm going to leave the BSG ads avenue for now--it didn't really go anywhere. The
history of other mono-eyes in cinema is worth a quick tour though. For obvious
reasons, I'm limiting these to things that occur before 1979. These are the
major ones:

- Gort, from _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ (1951)
- Cyclops from _Jason and the Argonauts_ (1963)
- HAL 9000 from _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968)
- Gigan from _Godzilla vs Gigan_ (1972).

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/cyclops-gort-hal-gigan.png"
  caption="From top-left to bottom-right: Cyclops from _Jason and the Argonauts_
  (1963); Gort from _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ (1951); HAL 9000 from _2001:
  A Space Odyssey_ (1968); Gigan from _Godzilla vs. Gigan_ (1972)"
%}

Of all of these, I want to focus on HAL and Gort. There's probably some really
interesting research to be done (or already done) about the role of the giant
cyclops as antagonist. The Zimmerit article puts this really well, so I'm just
going to quote it:

> It is inhuman.

> It is the other.

> It is the enemy.

I do want to say briefly at least about Gigan that the fact that it's a _Gojira_
baddie, is interesting. It gives it a certain...
[relationship](https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2127-godzilla-poetry-after-the-a-bomb)
to nuclear explosions and WWII. This I think is important--the Zaku is a
nuclear-powered machine, and we see one go critical in the first two episodes of
_Mobile Suit Gundam_, catastrophically destroying Amuro's home colony in Side 7.
But, like Harryhausen's Cyclops, I'm still going to mark this one off as being the
kind of coincidence that happens when people creating popular culture also
happen to consume popular culture.

HAL and Gort though... I think we have a little more to work with here.

I'm going to start with Gort. I think this is probably the strongest influence
on both the Cylon and Zaku's eyes. Gort's eye behaves in a way that looks like
it's a direct antecedent of the other two:

<div class="videowrapper">
  <iframe
    width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K6iF5sINVns?start=78"
    frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen ></iframe>
</div>

<br />

Gort's red eye isn't a discrete circle (and technically we can't know that it's
red either from this clip), and it doesn't exactly sweep, but it still has what I
think, over the next 30 years, would evolve into the Cylon's sweep.

But this article is about the Zaku. If you rewind that clip to 1:18 (where
it's set to start in the embed), the first thing you'll see is the visor slowly
and ominously lift to reveal the eye panel, which then lights up. Compare to the
first time we see a Zaku in Gundam, ever:

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/first-zaku-eye-small.gif"
  caption="The first figure onscreen in Gundam, _ever_ (other than the opening
  credits)"
%}

It's not a shot-for-shot recreation of the Gort scene... but there are a few
strong similarities.

- the camera focuses tightly on the visor area at first
- there is a shared revelation that the eyes behind the mask (visor for Gort,
    black glass for the Zaku) are fundamentally _not human_. It's easy to forget,
    but the first time you see the Zaku there isn't anything to give it scale.
    It could just be a human in a spacesuit. The single eye starts troubling that.
    Similarly, Gort could be a person in a spacesuit
- next is the slow ignition of the eye, which for both has a pulse where the
    light brightens then fades slightly. This creates a sense that the eye is
    focusing when it is first revealed. We as the audience likely mirror this
    in the miniscule muscles around our eyes[^mirror-neurons], which helps
    us understand the alien action

Both of these eyes convey a sense of foreboding. Gort delivers on this shortly
after the shot on its eyes by attacking, but the Zaku takes a little longer...
though there is good argument that the visual design of the Zaku has some
antecedents in Japanese modern history that would have telegraphed to its
Japanese audience that it was "Not A Good Guy" already after that first shot
(more on this in a minute).

## Mobile Suit Gundam and 2001: A Space Odyssey

Before we get into historical influences on the Zaku's appearance, I still want
to talk about HAL and the Zaku. Based on just the red eye, I'd probably just
ignore this as a coincidence, but there are other strong indicators that _2001_
was a major stylistic influence on _Mobile Suit Gundam_. Two examples:

Some of the Newtype connection moments, with colors and lights streaming across
the screen and the characters' visors as we dive further into a psychedelic
tunnel look a lot like some of Kubrick's shots:

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/2001-msg-comparisons.png"
  caption="From top left to bottom right: Amuro with Newtype space streaming
  across his visor in "The Newtype: Challia Bull", Bowman passing through the
  Stargate in _2001_ with very similar effects, the Stargate's color pipe, and a
  very similar color pipe representing Gundam's Newtype space."
%}

Also, the Ball Mobile Suit (...I guess it's a Mobile Suit?) looks _very_
inspired by the Space Pod from _2001_:

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/ball-space-pods.png"
  caption="From left to right: _Gundam_'s RB-79 Ball;
  the Space Pod from _2001_; a variation of _Gundam_'s
  Ball looking even more like the _2001_ Space Pod...
  and **called** a Space Pod"
%}

It's also worth watching all of "A Cosmic Glow", episode 41, and keeping _2001_
in mind while watching that's the core of the episode's story.

Considering what else _Gundam_ inherits from _2001_ visually, and the movie's
prominence in sci-fi, I think that Tomino had this in mind when/if he said to
Okawara "just give it a monoeye".

It's worth noting that there's lots of mythology about Tomino's love for
Kubrick. Again, it's one of those things that can be hard to track down, though
it sounds very right to me. [This is a thread on
mechatalk.net](https://www.mechatalk.net/viewtopic.php?t=16378&start=20) with a
few references to Tomino being influenced by Kubrick (which feels like a gimme
even without citation), and even that he said if anyone were to do a live action
Gundam, Tomino would want it to be Kubrick (the poster also notes that Tomino
said this _after_ Kubrick died... which if I'm honest sounds very Tomino and
makes me think this is something he actually said--it's exactly his kind of
shenanigans).

# Historical influences on the Zaku's appearance

This is one of those connections that relies on a careful viewer, since there is
little to no documentary evidence of it. But. I've been talking a lot with
[Thom](https://www.twitter.com/mecha_tho), one of the hosts of [Mobile Suit
Breakdown](https://www.gundampodcast.com) (and a very good friend from
forever)[^watching-gundam-with-thom-forever] about this research I'm doing.

He's drawn some rather compelling connections between the Zaku design and
Japanese airforce flightsuits:

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/kamikaze-pilot-and-jaaf-gunner.png"
  caption="The flightsuit of a Japanese kamikaze pilot, and a JAAF gunner with
  mask on, looking through a gun's sight (inset)"
%}

I don't know about you, but that mask on the flightsuit illustration looks _a
lot_ like Okawara's early Zaku sketch. There's something about the angles of the
brow and cheeks, and the sharp separation of the eye areas that makes it an
expressive mask.

Also, and it has to be said, that red sun on the pilot's headband could easily
be mistaken for the glowing red eye of a familiar mobile suit.

I really think Thom is right with these two. Their sharp historical connection
would certainly work to tie the Zaku to the role of aggressor in a Japanese
audience's mind (whether that makes them the villains is a political question
that... is sadly still in play).

I'm about to jump into a visual source for the Zaku that I have some good
documentation for, but that doesn't _exclude_ these visual references. We're
going to wrap back around to this, so just keep these in mind.

# Okawara's design retrospective leads us to _Barbarella_

I've hinted at this before, but the Zaku _also_ takes its design almost directly
from Barbarella, which blew my mind when I found out. It was also one of those
moments where I had to reread what I was seeing a couple of times. This was the
first real documentary breakthrough with a solid primary source I had while
researching this. (It was a very cool moment.)

Kunio Okawara, the mechanical designer for _Mobile Suit Gundam_, had a
retrospective exhibition in Japan in 2013. As with many of these, an exhibition
companion book was published, _Kunio Okawara: Legend of Mechanical Design_. This
books is gorgeous, and has some _very_ cool prints of some early Gundam designs,
as well as designs for Daitarn 3 (the show Okawara and Tomino worked on together
before Gundam), and later Gundam series.

<ImageCaption>

  take good pictures of books you're afraid to bend or damage.
</ImageCaption>

In addition to being absolutely gorgeous, this book also includes some
interviews with Okawara, translated into English. This is where I struck gold.
Here's the passage that opened up some new avenues for research for me:

> Q: ...I understand that the original idea for Zaku came from a poster for
> the film _Barbarella_ that appeared in the first issue of _Starlog_ magazine,
> and that you were also inspired by the enemy knight Blackguard.

> Okawara: At the time, the enemy characters weren't being turned into
> merchandise, so you were free to do whatever you wanted. And the [anime
> director] Yoshiyuki Tomino didn't ask me to do anything in particular. I even
> got the okay to do asymmetrical designs, which were hated at the time. This
> was what led the Zaku to be a character. Creating Zaku also allowed me to
> discover the approach used for Zeon armed forces.

> -- "Interview 01", _Kunio Okawara: Legend of Mechanical Design_ page 16

I want to pull a few things out of this:

First, I _love_ that he calls the mechanical designs characters. I think it's a
very smart (and correct) point of view. Mobile Suits aren't all that different
from masks in theatre, which do a huge amount of work to communicate character.

Second, I just want to call out that this report of Tomino having no instruction
is contradicted in other sources (notably _Gundam Age_), though these kinds of
contradiction are honestly everywhere. The truth is likely some combination of
them.

Third, it's pretty cool that the entire Zeon aesthetic spun out of this one MS.

When I first read this it didn't really hit. Then I reread and freaked out.

I've tried to figure out which "Blackguard" this is referring to, but haven't
had any luck. Final Fantasy wouldn't be released for several years, so it's not
there, and as far as I can tell there is no "Blackguard" in the first editions
of _Dungeons and Dragons_, which had made it to Japan at this time. It's been a
dead-end for me, so I'm leaving it be.

So, let's look into that _Barbarella_ poster...

## The Barbarella poster

For the _Barbarella_ poster, I was pretty sure it was the main poster for the
movie, the one many of us know:

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/classic-barbarella-poster-small.png"
  caption="The Barbarella poster most of us know"
%}

When I tracked down this specific back-issue from Japan, I was right. There were
also some extra surprise goodies in the issue, but I'll get to those in a
minute. Here, in all my bad-photo glory, is the image that inspired the general
look of the Zaku:

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/starlog-1-cover-barbarella-poster.png"
  caption="The holy grail: the first issue of the Japanese edition of _Starlog_.
  Cover on the left, _Barbarella_ art on the right."
%}

Getting this magazine issue in the post was far more exciting than it had any
right to be. I can't read it, the print quality is... old, let's say, and all of
the content is 4 decades out of date (though I have wondered what would happen
if I tried to send away for the mail-order geek-gear advertised in the back
pages). And yet... this is a piece of Gundam history, and I am nothing if not a
giant Gundam nerd. It was thrilling.

But back to business. You see those angry-looking dudes in the armor on the
bottom left over there? Yea. That's the Zaku's grandpappy. I'm going to point
out some relevant design elements that show up on the Zaku or elsewhere in
Gundam.

- the whips that appear to protrude from the arm get used on the Gouf
- the fins on the side of the helmet show up in an early Zaku design
- the armor's skirt shows up on the Zaku, Gouf, Dom... most Zeon MS to be honest
    (I'm guessing this is one of the ways in which the Zaku design process
    influenced a lot of the rest of the Zeon designs)
- that tightly cinched waist under a powerful chest
- the ribs along the chest look a little like the T-shape on the Zaku's cockpit design
- the armored pauldrons appear on both the Zaku and Gouf shoulders
- the sharp dip in the visor looks familiar, though more like the Gouf's angular
    face than the Zaku's

In fact, altogether I see a lot of similarities between these baddies and this
second round Zaku draft:

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/early-zaku-with-horns-small.png"
  caption="The horns on this Zaku don't survive to the final design. There are
  also better versions of this image out there, but the horns often disappear in
  the transparencies"
%}

I think it's also interesting that in the recent interview Okawara mentions the
influence of the business suit on the Zaku's design. I can kind of see that
dovetailing with the _Barbarella_ baddie. If you do an [image search for "1980
business
suit"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=1980+business+suit&atb=v126-7&iax=images&ia=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F736x%2F7b%2F82%2F14%2F7b82146dedda1f6d37fb71b4c6475b92--business-suits-the-s.jpg)
you get a lot of images where the suits give the impression of a slight cinch at
the waist, which has the effect of visually broadening the chest. Looking at
this Zaku design, and the _Barbarella_ baddie, I can see some visual rhymes.

## Barbarella and the Japanese Airforce, combine!

At this point we have two different stories for where the Zaku design came from:

- JAAF flightsuits and gasmasks[^gasmask-design-inspiration]
- the badguy from the Barbarella poster

It sees likely to me that they both were in play. I'm going to include some Zaku
drafts again, that trace an evolution of the design.

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/side-by-side-zaku-drafts.png"
  caption="On the left, the more refined (but still early)
    design that shows striking similarity to the Barbarella villain; on the
    right, the very early design I think was inspired by the gasmask and
    flightsuit"
%}

It's funny how little these two designs look like each other at first glance,
but there are some similarities that carry through from one to the other.

On the earlier sketch, the wide smile-like grate and circular vents to
either side of the mouth-grate give it a strong sense of, for lack of a
better word, sideways-ness.

It's an emphasis on the lateral axis that I think shows up in the later Zaku
head designs, there created by the conduit piping running from the nozzle grates
around to the sides.

There's also already some basic shape taking form with wide hips, slightly
narrower waist, and a broad chest again. This might be where Okawara's business
suit influence is showing up.

There's also that head in the top-left of the sketch page (which again, comes
from page 79 of _Gundam Age_). It's much rounder, and has the conduiting running
from a central nozzle grate to the sides. It also has a central vertical bar
that splits its visor. The shape of the head looks more like the later Zaku or
Gouf (or possibly even the Gelgoog), but the general structure of it looks _a
lot_ like the Zaku I:

{% include image.html
  img="assets/images/post-images/zaku-gouf-gelgoof-sketch-heads.png"
  caption="From top-left to bottom-right: the Zaku I head from its original
  Gunpla box art; the Zaku II head from its original Gunpla boxart; the Gelgoog
  head from its original Gunpla box art; the sketch head with the split visor;
  and the Gouf head from its reissued Gunpla box art (the original art didn't
  give a good enough view)"
%}

The attitude or mood of the sketch, with the face's angularity and narrowed
eyes feels reminiscent of the Gouf's or even Gelgoog's more fierce faces. But
that split visor is right there on the Zaku I. Also, I wonder if the the up-pointing
ornamentation in the sketch has a faint echo in what I lovingly call the Zaku

# Coming back to the possibility of cross-pollination with Battlestar...

Early on I despaired of connecting BSG to Gundam directly; the search was not
fruitful. I figured because of production and import schedules that there
wouldn't have been opportunity for cross-pollination.

That changed when the first back-issue of _Starlog_ arrived. The first few pages
of the magazine are given over to ads and promotional material. Which included
ads for the upcoming sci-fi epic _Battlestar Galactica_:

  caption="Advertising for _Battlestar Galactica_ in the first issue of
  _Starlog_ from August 1978"
%}

It's not a smoking gun connecting the Cylon Centurion to the Zaku yet, because
there aren't any Centurions in this two-page spread. But it does mean that there
was already cultural exchange and knowledge of _Battlestar_ in Japan at the
time, which means that pulsing, sweeping Cylon eye could have influenced Tomino
and Okawara.

When I saw this I immediately went back to Mandarake to get more back issues,
specifically those from the end of 1978. Issue 2 was unavailable, but I did get
issue 3 from October. It _does_ have Centurions. Lots of Centurions.

  Centurions; and a merch mail-order form, also including Centurion heads"
%}

I would be more than willing to bet that there were images of Cylons showing up
in other Japanese sci-fi media as early as October, and possibly even August
with the first issue of _Starlog_ came out. And, there's no guarantee that
Okawara got the first issue of _Starlog_ immediately on release (I've also not
been able to find production timelines for _Mobile Suit Gundam_ to get an idea
of when the Zaku design would have been finalized).

I'm not trying to say that Okawara and Tomino plagiarized the design here, not
by a long shot. I think that given the number and variety of influences on the
Zaku design, it's pretty clear that the Zaku's design is unique and powerful
unto itself (basically the thesis of the excellent Zimmerit article. Seriously.
Go read it).

What I do find interesting though, is that two incredibly iconic villains showed
up in the same year, and shared a very specific character marker: their monoeye.
And most interestingly, they use that marker to convey very different things
about themselves and their danger.

When you work with theatrical masks, you talk about how a mask 'plays'.
Different masks ask performers to act in certain ways, which is why Arlecchino
(predecessor of the Harlequin, and _very_ much alive in characters like Batman's
Harley Quinn) pushes performers to very precise, exaggerated, sometimes
extraneous, fast, and overblown movements that usually create comedy.

Masks also have what's called a 'countermask', a secondary character that is
usually the opposite of the masks's primary character, when the mask is played
differently. If you think about Harley Quinn, she can jump between mask and
countermask very quickly: from zany bouncing comedy play, to murderous and
sharply focused direct play. The Joker also does this incredibly effectively,
and as a side note I think these two are part of the reason that _Batman: The
Animated Series_ was so excellent.[^joker]

Given the similarity of the Zaku and Cylon Centurion's masks at the level of
their physical construction, I find it useful to think about their differences
in terms of the way their monoeyes play.

The Centurion's simple sweeping eye makes it seem truly alien to us. When we
humans scan our environment and look around, it's a series of focal points. Our
eyes move, dial in, and perceive for a moment. Then we repeat. The Cylon's
constant and un-mammalian sweep is almost the opposite, and I think one of the
reasons they are so imposing and unnerving as
villains[^farscape-zhaan-inhuman-portrayal].

The Zaku on the other hand moves and focuses its eye in discrete movements much
like we do, but here, it's the lack of a second eye that really gets under the
skin and communicates danger.

Having a single, expressionless eye ignite and swivel to focus on something
communicates a singularity of purpose that is often associated with predators.
It evokes the image of a tiger stalking prey, its head staying perfectly level
and still even as its body rises and falls with its steps and the terrain. For
the Zaku, having a single eye communicates that it is fully focused on whatever
it is looking at.

# Wrapping it up

This has been a very interesting dive into the background of the Zaku. When it
all started, I had the idea that there might be a connection between the Cylon
and the Zaku. I still can't be 100% sure that that's the case, but considering the
timing of when _Battlestar_ was being promoted in Japan in relation to when
Okawara was looking at _Starlog_ issue 1 for inspiration, it seems likely to me
that the Zaku is in a conversation with the Cylon.

Tomino is too canny and creative a director for this to be anywhere close to the
realm of plagiarism. He has a  history of taking established tropes and doing
something _new_ with them (what else is _Gundam_ if not a reinvention of the
mecha anime, using an existing set of symbols to tell a _very_ different story?).

If Tomino did see the Cylon before telling Okawara to give the Zaku a monoeye,
and even if that was what gave him the idea, all we need to do is look at the
difference in the stories that these two monoeyes tell to know that Tomino is
reinventing a symbol to tell his own story. Where the Cylon's eye creates danger
by being sweeping and inhuman, the Zaku adds articulation and a more human play
to its mask, and achieves a much more familiar kind of danger--the danger we
sense in a mind that we _can_ fathom, through its more familiar play.

They're both fascinating evolutions of Gort's eye, and maybe even HAL's.

Beyond the eye, I did not expect the variety of influences on the Zaku's design
that I found. That it combines _Barbarella_'s stormtrooper, JAAF flightsuits and
gasmasks, and even business suits, is surprising. And the ability to trace those
through the versions of the Zaku, and even into the Gouf and other mobile suits,
is very cool.

It all comes together into a design that has stood up for 40 years. If you spend
enough time in Gundam fandom, you often hear that it is as influential in Japan
as _Star Wars_, and the Zaku is a big part of that. Unlike so many other
mechanical designs over the years, it is still relevant and compelling, and I
think that its real-world links, and the story that its single articulating eye
tells are a big part of why it sticks in our minds and imaginations.

[^gundam-age]: _Gundam Age_ (published April 9, 1999, ISBN 4-89691-379-5) is a book that celebrates Gundam and Gunpla for the most part. It's very cool looking... but I can't read it.
[^asymmetry-of-design]: "Interview 01", _Kunio Okawara: Legend of Mechanical Design_ page 16
[^mirror-neurons]: This is something to do with our mirror neurons and the way we use them to empathize with and understand others around us. If you've ever been sitting in a horror movie, or, like me, in a clown show, and find yourself mirroring the expressions on the performers' faces, this is a lot like that. It's a major part of how we learn, and continues on in play and our consumption of art. For more, check out _On the Origin of Stories_ by Brian Boyd (2009), or any number of neuropsych research.
[^watching-gundam-with-thom-forever]: Seriously. We've been watching Gundam together since _00_ was first airing, and we were both thrilled to have someone else who understood why tf we were so in love with these dumb giant robots (and their dumb pilots who insisted they were the giant robots...).
[^gasmask-design-inspiration]: In fact, the [Japanese Zaku Wikipedia article](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B6%E3%82%AFII) makes reference to a gas mask Okawara had lying around as part of the facial inspiration: "There are no such things as "two drafts are decided". The motif is a suit suit and a gas mask that was suitable for the store at home. However, the thorny ornament of Zaku of the head is not Okawara, but it is due to the idea of general manager Yoshiyuki Tomino. Especially mono eye can be confirmed by image sketch of mobile suits drawn by Tomino." (Translation by our dear friend Google Chrome and its weirdness... but you get the bit about the gasmask at least).
[^farscape-zhaan-inhuman-portrayal]: io9 recently published an [article on the legacy of _Farscape_](https://web.archive.org/web/20190410135322/https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-look-back-at-farscape-aliens-puppets-and-criminals-1833716459) where they talk about similar things with Virginia Hey's approach to the alien Zhaan--she focused a lot on stillness and suppression of very human stop-start motion: "the instinct of ‘fight or flight’ when any worrying stimulus comes their way, and adrenaline gates open, creating floods of stress. I tried to still that whole process, thereby making Zhaan non-human."
[^joker]: Mark Hamill's vocal work also does this, turning on a dime from zany Joker to murderous Joker. Similarly, Heath Ledger's ability to combine these two sides in a performance more grounded in realism is one of the reasons he was so good in the role. That scene where he's demanding a seat at the table with the gangsters and they blow him off, in part because he appears weak because he's just... floppy, then turns in an instant and puts the pencil through the crony's head is some performance magic.
