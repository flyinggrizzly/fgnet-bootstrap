| **[s301](https://github.com/flyinggrizzly/s301)**  | A Rails based URL shortener. It maintains all redirects in Postgres, but rather than making users wait for DB lookups before redirect, publishes all shortened URLs to S3 (ideally more services to be added later), and invalidates the service's CloudFront cache. |

### Community

I write on my own blog here, as well as contribute to the University of Bathâ€™s [Digital team blog](https://blogs.bath.ac.uk/digital)

I have done lightning talks on **Prototyping with Dokku**, **Learning by wanting to look cool**, [HTTPS and Asymmetric Encryption](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fNcPYa5ToZDd_cM49I7Emx4hQMo5MhQUxXLPF1w5gaQ/edit?usp=sharing), and [using code to cope with depression](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oG6STwsticSt3aNQStaYefSsbOtR0gqSDV8OhXihQvc/edit?usp=sharing).
